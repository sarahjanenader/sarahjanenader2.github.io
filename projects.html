    </h2>
        <p> This short documentary explores the issue of HIV Criminalization in the United States. When the HIV epidemic began in the 1980s, homophobia and stigma around the disease ran ramped: News headlines warned of the “Gay plague,” and the government passed laws to criminalize the behaviors of people living with HIV. Now, over 40 years later, the medical community has a much better understanding of HIV. Research has led to the development of effective HIV treatment, including antiretroviral therapy, which can make a person living with HIV untransmittable. Despite the drastic advancements in HIV care, stigma, and legal discrimination persist. Today, 35 out of 50 U.S. states uphold laws criminalizing people living with HIV for engaging in consensual sexual activities. Criminalizing a disease does not help to stop its spread, it only fuels stigma and discrimination. I hope that this documentary will raise awareness of the harmful effects of HIV criminalization laws, and promote advocacy efforts to reform them. Our video includes a combination of interview and observational content. We present viewers with historical context, a personal story of injustice, and an inspiring message from an activist organization leader. We also included powerful imagery of the LGBTQ+ community coming together to rally, which was shot at a recent protest.
